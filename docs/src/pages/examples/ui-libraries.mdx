# UI Libraries Examples

Most popular Vue.js UI libraries come with their own built-in form logic and some may tackle a lot of what vee-validate tackles. If you find yourself not satisfied with said library's logic, you can add vee-validate power up these components.

vee-validate is UI-agnostic, it doesn't offer any special treatment for the elements/components as long as they emit the right events.

Integrating vee-validate can be different for each UI library, it mostly depends on the library's ability to outsource the form logic to 3rd party logic and how it tracks the form field values.

In the next few examples you will find examples on how to do that in various ways with the most popular Vue.js libraries in no particular order.
